# United States Geological Survey (USGS) Last Week Earthquakes

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. USGS scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

This project has been divided in 2 parts.


### Part 1 - Visualization of last week earthquakes

The first map displays the location of the earthquakes. These can be viewed using a street or topography maps. Users can also select between Markers Clausters, Circles or Heatmap.


### Part 2 - Visualization of last week earthquakes and Tatonic Plates

The second map is like the first one, but it also allows users to select Tatonic Plates to the chart.
